# Meta Principles

- Phases contain sub-phases
- Sub-phases contain sub-phase-components
- Phases, sub-phases and sub-phase-components can be linked to mental models
- Mental models are representations of heuristics which can take the shape of 2x2 matrixes (magic quadrants), funnels, and x-y curves.
- Visualization shifts, from one type to a completely different one, can take place when going from phases to sub-phases to sub-phase-components. However, these relationships can also be visualized in a flat way to get a complete overview of everything.
