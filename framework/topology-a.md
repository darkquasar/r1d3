# Meta Principles

- Phases contain sub-phases
- Sub-phases contain components
- Components include actions
- Components and actions produce outputs
- Sub-phases produce outcomes
- Phases, sub-phases and components can be linked to mental models
- Mental models are representations of heuristics which can take the shape of 2x2 matrixes (magic quadrants), funnels, and x-y curves.
