summary: >
  DAIKI is a semantic-chain model for threat hunting and data analysis that
  structures work along Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Insight to maximise impact.
description: |
  The DAIKI model (Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Insight) is an adaptation
  of the DIKW pyramid applied to threat hunting and security analytics. It
  emphasises where in the semantic chain a hunt begins and how synthesis steps
  transform low-value atomic data into high-impact operational insight.
  DAIKI is mission-driven: outcomes farther along the chain typically deliver
  greater organisational resilience and clearer risk reduction.
principles:
  - semantic-positioning
  - synthesis-first
  - impact-driven
  - bounded-applicability
  - verification-and-provenance
stages:
  - visualization:
      type: svg
      src_file: diagrams/hunt-data-semantics.svg
  - phases:
      - id: data
        name: Data
        description: "Atomic, disconnected observations (logs, hashes, alerts). Primary focus: collection and normalization."
        dominant_question: "What?"
        typical_outputs:
          - raw_events
          - normalized_records
      - id: information
        name: Information
        description: "Contextualised data (enriched events, correlated artifacts). Primary focus: adding context and relationships."
        dominant_question: "What (in context)?"
        typical_outputs:
          - correlated_timeline
          - entity_profiles
      - id: knowledge
        name: Knowledge
        description: "Interpreted information (hypotheses, adversary behaviours, tactics). Primary focus: explain why events occurred."
        dominant_question: "Why?"
        typical_outputs:
          - hypotheses
          - mapped_tactics_and_techniques
      - id: insight
        name: Insight
        description: "Assimilated knowledge that drives decisions and new practices (mitigations, playbooks). Primary focus: how to act and change behaviour."
        dominant_question: "How?"
        typical_outputs:
          - operational_playbooks
          - impact_assessments
          - strategic_recommendations
transitions:
  data_to_information: "Contextualisation: enrich and correlate events to reveal patterns and relationships."
  information_to_knowledge: "Interpretation: form hypotheses that explain observed patterns and map to adversary behaviours."
  knowledge_to_insight: "Assimilation: convert validated hypotheses into operational change, mitigations, and measurable impact."
impact_model:
  description: >
    Impact is produced at every semantic level, but increases as outcomes progress
    toward Insight. Starting analysis further along the chain (e.g., at Knowledge)
    typically requires less raw processing to reach Insight and yields higher immediate impact.
  guidance:
    - "Drive hunts toward Insight when mission and resources allow."
    - "Quantify impact as change in organisational resilience or risk exposure."
hunt_roles_and_triggers:
  description: "Define who or what triggers hunts and how role/responsibility maps to semantic start positions."
  examples:
    - trigger: "SOC alert triage"
      likely_start: "Data -> Information"
    - trigger: "Threat intelligence feed"
      likely_start: "Information -> Knowledge"
    - trigger: "Strategic risk assessment"
      likely_start: "Knowledge -> Insight"
inputs:
  - name: raw_data
    type: array
    description: "Raw telemetry, logs, alerts, and artifacts."

    description: "Threat intel, reputation lists, config/context data."
  - name: mission_context
    type: object
    description: "Organisational priorities, assets, and risk appetite to guide bounded applicability."
outputs:
  - name: artifacts
    type: array
    description: "Normalized events, correlated timelines, entity profiles, hypotheses, playbooks."
  - name: impact_assessment
    type: object
    description: "Measured change in risk/resilience attributable to hunt outcomes."
workflow_patterns:
  - name: semantic-progression
    steps:
      - "Collect and normalise Data."
      - "Contextualise into Information (enrichment & correlation)."
      - "Interpret into Knowledge (hypothesis generation & mapping to adversary behaviour)."
      - "Validate and assimilate into Insight (playbooks, mitigations, measurable impact)."
  - name: start-position-aware
    description: "Select tooling and effort proportional to the semantic start position to optimise time-to-insight."
evaluation_metrics:
  - name: time_to_insight
    description: "Elapsed time from hunt trigger to actionable insight."
  - name: impact_delta
    description: "Quantitative reduction in organisational risk or vulnerability attributable to the hunt."
  - name: hypothesis_validation_rate
    description: "Fraction of hypotheses that are confirmed, refuted, or require iteration."
  - name: coverage_of_relevant_entities
    description: "Proportion of critical assets and entities covered by the analysis."
limitations:
  - "Starting at raw Data can be resource-intensive and may yield low immediate impact without effective synthesis."
  - "Bias in enrichment sources or bounding choices can lead to missed scenarios."
  - "Errors in interpretation propagate; iterative validation is required."
safety_guidelines:
  - "Preserve privacy and minimise exposure of sensitive telemetry when sharing artifacts."
  - "Record provenance for all enrichment and interpretation steps."
  - "Validate operational mitigations in controlled environments before large-scale deployment."
recommended_use_cases:
  - "Threat hunting workflows that prioritise mission impact"
  - "Mapping detections to adversary behaviours and mitigation playbooks"
  - "Designing measurement frameworks for hunt effectiveness and organisational resilience"
anti_use_cases:
  - "Treating DAIKI as a prescriptive checklist for unrelated domains without adapting bounded applicability"
  - "Using raw atomic checks (e.g., only hash sweeps) as the sole hunting strategy when impact is the goal"
