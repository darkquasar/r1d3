description: |
  Zero Breach Operations represents the pinnacle of defensive security maturity.
  This strategic goal requires sustained excellence across prevention, detection,
  and response capabilities, measured through multiple lagging indicators that
  demonstrate systemic improvement in security posture.
strategic_goal: |
  Achieve and maintain a state where no adversary successfully compromises critical
  systems or exfiltrates sensitive data, measured over rolling 12-month periods.
lagging_indicators:
  - "Zero confirmed data breaches in past 12 months"
  - "Mean time to detect (MTTD) under 15 minutes"
  - "Mean time to respond (MTTR) under 1 hour"
  - "100% of critical assets protected by defense-in-depth controls"
  - "Security maturity score: 4.5/5.0 or higher"
driven_by_outcomes:
  - reduced-attack-surface
  - improved-detection-capability
  - faster-incident-response
measurement_period: "Rolling 12 months"
