description: Adopt contextual limits and modeling choices that constrain analysis to meaningful data clusters
guidance: |
  Inspired by Cynefin framework, recognize that different data domains require different analytical
  approaches. Bound your hunt scope based on data characteristics, system complexity, and available
  context. Not all hunts suit all data types. Match your methodology to your domain.
examples:
  - "Structured log data suits algorithmic analysis; unstructured artifacts require manual review"
  - "High-fidelity endpoint telemetry enables behavioral hunting; sparse network logs require indicator-based approaches"
  - "Known-bad searches work in simple domains; pattern analysis needed in complex environments"
