description: Differentiate hunt types by their position in the semantic chain where analysis starts
guidance: |
  Understanding where a hunt begins in the Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Insight chain
  helps determine the appropriate tooling, effort, and expected time-to-insight. Hunts starting
  at higher semantic levels (Knowledge/Insight) typically require less raw processing and yield
  higher immediate impact.
examples:
  - "Starting at Data level requires extensive normalization and correlation before insights emerge"
  - "Starting at Knowledge level with threat intelligence allows rapid hypothesis testing"
  - "Starting at Insight level with strategic assessments enables immediate tactical planning"
