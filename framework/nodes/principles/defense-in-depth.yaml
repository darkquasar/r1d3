description: Layer multiple security controls so that if one fails, others continue to provide protection
guidance: |
  Apply multiple independent layers of security controls throughout your architecture.
  No single point of failure should compromise the entire system. Each layer should
  use different defensive techniques to maximize coverage against various attack vectors.
examples:
  - "Network segmentation + Host-based firewalls + Application-level authentication"
  - "Encryption at rest + Encryption in transit + Key rotation + Access controls"
  - "Web Application Firewall + Input validation + Parameterized queries + Principle of least privilege"
