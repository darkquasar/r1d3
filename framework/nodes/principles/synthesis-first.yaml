version: "1.0"
description: Progress through explicit synthesis steps that convert data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into insight
guidance: |
  Each transition in the semantic chain requires deliberate synthesis activities. Raw data
  becomes information through contextualization. Information becomes knowledge through interpretation.
  Knowledge becomes insight through assimilation and action planning. Skip these steps at your peril.
examples:
  - "Enriching logs with threat intelligence transforms data into contextual information"
  - "Mapping correlated events to MITRE ATT&CK transforms information into actionable knowledge"
  - "Converting validated hypotheses into detection rules transforms knowledge into operational insight"
