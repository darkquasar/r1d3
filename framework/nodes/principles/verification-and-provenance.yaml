  Provenance enables peer review, supports quality assurance, and allows others to reproduce or
  refute your findings. Verification ensures your insights withstand scrutiny.
examples:
  - "Tag all enrichment sources so analysts can assess data quality and freshness"
  - "Document hypothesis generation logic to enable reproducibility"
  - "Capture decision points and alternatives considered during hunt execution"
