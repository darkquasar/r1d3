description: Prioritize outcomes that increase organizational resilience and measure impact at each stage
guidance: |
  Every hunt should have a measurable impact on organizational security posture. Define success
  criteria upfront. Track whether findings lead to reduced risk, improved detection, or enhanced
  response capabilities. Impact is the ultimate measure of hunting effectiveness.
examples:
  - "Hunt findings that lead to new detection rules increase long-term defensive capability"
  - "Identifying infrastructure gaps that get remediated reduces attack surface"
  - "Documenting TTPs that inform security roadmap improves strategic resilience"
